This Project was born out of being given a small 5W laser (Creality Falcon) to use on my Ender 3 Pro.
But my eldest son is creative with cardboard so i wanted to expand the working area to help him push his skills forward while making it easier to create bigger and better things.
Having been in the 3D Printing game now for well over 3 years and my fondness towards Voron in particular i set about to create a Voron Inspired Build!
After starting with nothing more than a working size i set about creating the motion system.
This proved to be quite the challenge and after a few days of pondering, design and redesigning i came to the conclusion that it might be better to utilize what had already been created from the someone that is more skilled in this area.
the Voron Design Team have worked wonders in this field and as i wanted a Voron Design Theme using the motion system from the Trident fit the bill very well.
After a good productive 2 days pouring over the design, tweaking and adapting to my needs i managed to get the main bulk of the motion system complete.
after that it was getting all the smaller parts to work with each other. so end stops, electronics, energy chain support etc...

Having now spent many many hours fine tuning and adapting the design while also looking for easy to source and cheap components. it is now at the stage where i feel this is now finished bar a few tolerance checks but i wont know until i have printed out all the parts to check for fit and finish. I have acquired nearly all the parts for the frame and motion system so next is printed parts and basic assembly.

# !!! PLEASE BE VERY AWARE THAT LASERS ARE DANGEROUS !!!
# !!! THEY CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO PERSONAL PROPERTY !!!
# !!! AND BLIND YOU !!! PERMENANTLY !!!
# !!! EVEN REFLECTED LASER LIGHT WILL DO PERMENANT DAMAGE !!!

sorry but i have to cover the basics... on with the good stuff!

objectives for this project

A2 sized work area (with the idea to expand or contract it with minimal change to components)
cost effective (for all equipment needed including motion system)
use of off the shelf items (this is the way!)
keep as many parts printable (I have managed to keep it all printable on a Voron V0)
to use Klipper as the interface
incorporate a good level of safety into the system to reduce the human error factor

As this is a work in progress i am aware that there are some quite important parts missing.
these being...

(Main inlet / power socket
Laser safety shut off / kill switch
Klipper Emergency Shut Down
E-Stop
Klipper screen) These have now been added as of the current update.

Safety Circuitry (2 x relay to help remove laser exposure when machine is on but no laser is required... ie boot time or motion checking etc.)
i will provide a basic safety circuit but i will take no responsibility / liability and YOU MUST check that it fits with YOUR scope of safety!

Electronics Enclosure - to come later

Laser Enclosure - to come later

BOM - to come soon

# PLEASE NOTE THAT I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPOSEABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT (BOTH TO PROPERTY OR BODILY HARM) WHILE CREATING OR THE USE OF THIS TYPE OF MACHINE / EQUIPMENT AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS SOLELY ON THE PERSON(S) WHO HAS TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELFS TO USE WHAT I HAVE CREATED HERE.

with that said, any feedback or advice on stuff to change / adapt would be greatly appreciated!
